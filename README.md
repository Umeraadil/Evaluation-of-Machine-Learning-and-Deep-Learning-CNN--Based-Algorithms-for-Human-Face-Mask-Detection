# Evaluation-of-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-CNN--Based-Algorithms-for-Human-Face-Mask-Detection
Global pandemic COVID-19 circumstances emerged in an epidemic of dangerous disease in all over the world

Wearing a face mask will help prevent the spread of infection and prevent the individual from contracting any airborne infectious germs.
Using Face Mask Detection System, one can monitor if the people are wearing masks or not.Â 

In this work we evaluate the different machine learning and deep learning based algorithms for detection of human face mask.

We conducted all our experiments on five datasets. Among five datasets four are colored image datasets and one is grey image dataset.

The Machine learning Algorithms achieved 94% accuracy and Deep learning (CNN) Algorithms achieved 98% accuracy.

#Objectives![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcebfb29-7faf-46f5-aca8-491bc28f3882)

To identify and review the state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning models applied to detect face mask.  

To implement different Machine learning and deep learning techniques and computer intelligence to extract powerful features from images to construct a classifier that detects unmasked personnel with high accuracy. 

 To determine and discuss prediction accuracy and limitations of Machine learning and Deep learning(CNN) models applied to detect face masks. 

We also compare and evaluate deep learning techniques with Machine Learning techniques to decide the outperformance of one technique over another for higher accuracy results.
