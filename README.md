# Evaluation-of-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-CNN--Based-Algorithms-for-Human-Face-Mask-Detection
Global pandemic COVID-19 circumstances emerged in an epidemic of dangerous disease in all over the world

Wearing a face mask will help prevent the spread of infection and prevent the individual from contracting any airborne infectious germs.
Using Face Mask Detection System, one can monitor if the people are wearing masks or not. 

In this work we evaluate the different machine learning and deep learning based algorithms for detection of human face mask.

We conducted all our experiments on five datasets. Among five datasets four are colored image datasets and one is grey image dataset.

The Machine learning Algorithms achieved 94% accuracy and Deep learning (CNN) Algorithms achieved 98% accuracy.

# PRE-PROCESSING

In pre-processing the Region of Interest (RoI), which is lower portion of face comprising nose and mouth, is extracted from the human face image.

# Feature Extraction

In this work we use two texture based feature extraction techniques for mask detection on human faces. 

We use two feature extraction techniques i.e. 
	
      1) GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix)
	
       2) LBP (Local Binary Pattern).

#  Binary Classifiers!

SVM,

Decision Tree 

Logistic Regression

LDA

AdaBoost

Random Forest!

# Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
CNN consists of one or more convolution layers. CNN aims to find features that are effective inside an image rather than working with an entire image.

In this proposed work , we have applied deep CNN with 3 convolution layers.

We use to pooling operations in our CNN model i.e.
1:-MAX POOLING
2:-AVERAGE POOLING
